# Data-Visualizations-Project

Used a dataset from Kaggle, a Google-owned platform containing public datasets as well as other data science resources, which contained various information about social media users. The machine learning models were created to answer the question, "How is a social media userâ€™s income impacted by various different variables?", and we used the variables age, time spent on social media, demographics, profession, debt status, to make said prediction. This project was done on Google Colab, a cloud-based Jupyter notebook environment.
